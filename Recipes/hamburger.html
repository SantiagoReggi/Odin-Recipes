    <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often
        a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with
        cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1]</h2>

                Instructions Checklist

                Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam,
                about 5 minutes.

                Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour
                in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.
            </li>

                Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top.
                Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.

                Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the
                bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup
                sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
